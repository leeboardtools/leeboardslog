# Leeboards Log
A Java based Personal Log (or Journal or Diary) Application

In the "Good Enough for My Purposes" state...

The project is set up for Apache NetBeans IDE 11.0 with JDK 11 and OpenJavaFX 11.0.2.
See https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx for details on setting up Apache NetBeans 11.0
for use with OpenJavaFX.

You will need to create a JavaFX 11 library.

You will also need to set the PATH_TO_FX environmental variable:

 `export PATH_TO_FX=/path/to/javafx-sdk/lib`

- https://netbeans.org/ - Leeboard's Log is primarily developed using Apache NetBeans 11.0 IDE (well,
really NetBeans 8.2, but then Ubuntu bumped the OpenJavaFX to 11, which broke NetBeans 8.2 on
my machine, so I went ahead and jumped up to Apache NetBeans 11.0 and OpenJavaFX 11.0.2)
